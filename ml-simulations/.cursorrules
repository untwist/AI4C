# ML Simulations - Cursor Rules

## 🚫 STRICT NO EMOJIS POLICY

### This project has ZERO tolerance for emojis.

**Why?** This is a professional educational platform for SVA Continuing Education students. Emojis are:
- Unprofessional for academic content
- Accessibility barriers for screen readers
- Inconsistent across platforms
- Not appropriate for serious educational material

### What to do instead:
- Use clear, descriptive text
- Use CSS styling for emphasis
- Use professional academic language
- Use icons from icon libraries if needed

### Examples:

❌ **DON'T DO THIS:**
```tsx
<h3>🎯 Target Audience</h3>
<p>💡 This is a great tip!</p>
<button>📊 View Data</button>
<div className="feature-icon">🎓</div>
```

✅ **DO THIS INSTEAD:**
```tsx
<h3>Target Audience</h3>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> This is a great tip!</p>
<button>View Data</button>
<div className="feature-icon"></div>
```
